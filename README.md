Nested Commenting System - Inter IIT Tech Meet 14.0

This project is a full-stack web application developed as a selection task for the Inter IIT Tech Meet 14.0 Development Team. It features a modern, responsive interface for a nested commenting system, complete with user authentication, real-time interactions, and a scalable backend.

Frontend (Vercel): https://inter-iit-dev-task-9kji.vercel.app

Backend (Render): https://interiit-dev-task-2.onrender.com

‚ú® Features Implemented

User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Nested Comments: Infinite-level nested comment threads with a clean, indented UI.

Create Comments & Replies: Authenticated users can post top-level comments or reply to any existing comment.

Upvote Comments: Users can upvote comments to show appreciation or relevance.

Delete Comments: Users can delete their own comments. Deleting a parent comment also removes all its nested replies.

Real-time UI Updates: The interface updates instantly after creating, upvoting, or deleting comments without needing a page refresh.

Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

RESTful API: A well-structured backend API to manage users and comments.

Dockerized Backend: The backend is containerized with Docker for consistent and reliable deployment.

üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The project is structured as a monorepo with two distinct applications: a client (React SPA) and a server (Express.js REST API).

Backend Approach

The Node.js/Express server is responsible for all business logic, including user authentication and database operations. It exposes a set of RESTful endpoints that the client consumes. For efficiency, the /api/comments endpoint returns a flat array of all comments. This approach keeps the backend fast and delegates the task of structuring the nested data to the client.

Frontend Approach

The React application handles all UI rendering and state management. Upon fetching the flat array of comments from the server, it runs an efficient in-memory algorithm to transform the list into a nested tree structure. This is achieved by mapping parent-child relationships using the parent ID on each comment object. Components are then rendered recursively to display the infinite nesting. This client-side approach ensures a snappy user experience and reduces the load on the server.


üîå API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with /api.
